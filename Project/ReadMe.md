# Sentiment Analysis on Persian E-Commerce Reviews
This repository contains the code and documentation for a Machine Learning project that trains a sentiment analysis neural network using reviews from Persian e-commerce websites. The project was developed as part of the Fall 2023 curriculum at Sharif University of Technology.

## Overview
In this project, we build and fine-tune a sentiment analysis neural network. It leverages user comments from two popular Iranian platforms:

## Snappfood: A platform for ordering food online.
**Snappfood**: A platform for ordering a wide variety of foods and groceries online.
**Digikala**: An online store offering numerous product from different categories.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several sections, each corresponding to a different phase:

**P1: Exploring the Datasets**
Gain insights into the data by visualizing and summarizing key characteristics.

**P2: Preprocessing**
Prepare the data for model training by handling missing values, tokenizing text, and more.

**P3: Model Training**
Train a neural network for sentiment analysis using the Snappfood dataset.

**P4: Domain Adaptation**
Fine-tune the model on the Digikala dataset and evaluate its performance.

## Key Challenges:
Domain Adaptation: Adapting the model to handle domain shifts between Snappfood (food-related comments) and Digikala (general product reviews).
Data Processing: Cleaning, preprocessing, and exploring the datasets to extract meaningful insights.
